# Neural Networks with Numpy

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It consists of interconnected nodes, called neurons or artificial neurons, organized into layers. These layers can be broadly categorized into three types: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.

TensorFlow and PyTorch were widely recognized as the top two most popular deep learning libraries, each offering powerful capabilities for building and training neural networks. However, this model using only the numpy library to develop a simple neural network from first principles. 

The network has three fully connected weight layers, three inputs, and three-class softmax output. 
The first hidden layer has four neurons and the second eight neurons. 
All neurons have a single bias.
